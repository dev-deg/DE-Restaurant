# Restaurant Project

## Getting Started

After cloning the project, you need to follow the important steps below:

### Step 1: Install the packages

These will re-create your node_modules file

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2: Create a .env file
```text
DB_USERNAME=admin
DB_PASSWORD=mcast
```

### Step 3: Update the Url of your database

Replace <put your url here> with your own url. To obtain this, go to the clusters tab on Mongo Atlas website, Click on Connect, Select Drivers, Select Mongoose, copy the url from @ symbol onwards (excluding @ symbol).

```js
const uri = `mongodb+srv://${process.env.DB_USERNAME}:${process.env.DB_PASSWORD}@<put your url here>`;
```

## Troubleshooting Tips

- Check that your IP address is whitelisted in MongoAtlas. To do this go to Network Access in Mongo Atlas, and add the Ip address 0.0.0.0/0 for all users to be able to connect.
- Make sure that in your MongoAtlas, you have a database called restaurant and two collections called 'dishes' and 'drinks'. Mongoose will look specifically for these names.
- Try a different internet connection (MCAST ICT LAB PCs have blocked ports and will not be able to connect)
- You might also want to check your nodejs version to ensure it is up to date:
```bash
node --version
```
